# bambam955.github.io

My personal website, built using Astro.

## Inspiration

I plan to build this site mostly from scratch, taking inspiration from the design and source code of the following templates and sites:

| Repo | Example |
| --- | --- |
| https://github.com/bue221/astro-portfolio | https://bue221.vercel.app/ |
| https://github.com/tim-hub/techtim-astro-bento-portfolio | https://techtim42.com/ |
| https://github.com/antfu/antfu.me | https://antfu.me/ |

There may be other sites that have useful designs too. See https://github.com/bambam955/bambam955.github.io/issues/1 for additional links.

## Goals

I'm going to aim for a site that is sleek and minimalistic while still containing all the main features and pages that I want:

- Home page
- Project portfolio
- Resume/CV
  - Work experience
  - Education
  - Skills (tools, languages, etc)
  - Downloadable PDF of my actual resume
- Blog
- Links to socials/profiles
